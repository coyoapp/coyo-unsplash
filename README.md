Welcome to COYO's Android dev challenge!

Thank you very much for applying and especially for taking the time for this challenge.

## Set up

You need to register at https://unsplash.com if you aren't already. Afterwards, create an Unsplash app: https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications

Afterwards you need to get your access and secret key and configure those in your `local.properties` like so:

```
accessKey=someAccessK3y
secretKey=someSecretK3y
```

Then you should be able to start the app and run it! In case you don't want to create an account there, just reach out to us, we'll figure out a solution. 


## Interview preparation

Before the technical interview, please make yourself familiar with the app code and the used libraries. Also make sure to roughly check the API documentation: https://unsplash.com/documentation

During the interview you will share your screen and perform one or two small features in this app together with your interviewer. There will also be time for you to challenge the current implementation, what you'd have done differently, etc. 
No worries! The task will be quite small and this is not meant to become an unachieveable test with high pressure to make you look like a beginner or such. Also not solving the task is not necessary a failure at all. No need to be scared ðŸ˜„
