Welcome to COYO's Android dev challenge!

# Set up

You need to register at https://unsplash.com if you aren't already. Afterwards, create an Unsplash app: https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications

Afterwards you need to get your access and secret key and configure those in your `local.properties` like so:

```
accessKey=someAccessK3y
secretKey=someSecretK3y
```

Then you should be able to start the app and run it!
